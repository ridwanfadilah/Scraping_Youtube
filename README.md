# Scraping_Youtube
Scraping YouTube video data for title, views, likes, publish date, and likes within a certain period of time.

This project is a Python script that scrapes YouTube video data from a channel. It requires an API key and a channel ID. It can also specify the time period for which data will be collected and save it in CSV format for further processing.
